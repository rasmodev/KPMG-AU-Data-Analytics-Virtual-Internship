# Module 2: Data Insights and Presentation Using Excel
Welcome to Module 2 of my KPMG AU Data Analytics virtual internship showcase! In this module, I will guide you through my analysis of the three datasets provided and how I visualized the results using Microsoft Excel. Additionally, I created a PowerPoint presentation to offer recommendations on targeting high-value customers among the new dataset of 1,000 customers.

# 1. Introduction
In Module 2, I delved into the analysis phase of the KPMG Data Analytics internship. My focus was on gaining insights from the provided datasets and presenting these insights effectively using Excel and PowerPoint. By analyzing customer data, I aimed to identify valuable segments and make data-driven recommendations for customer targeting.

## 1.1. Tasks
- **Data Analysis:** Utilized Excel to analyze the three datasets, extracting meaningful insights from customer demographics, addresses, and transaction data.
- **Visualization:** Created pivot tables and charts to visualize key metrics and trends, aiding in the interpretation of data.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Employed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their transaction behavior.
- **Recommendation Presentation:** Designed a PowerPoint presentation to communicate findings and offer targeted customer recommendations.

## 1.2. Methodologies
- **Data Merging:** Combined relevant columns from the customer demographic and customer address datasets with the transaction dataset using Excel's VLOOKUP function.
- **Pivot Tables:** Created pivot tables to aggregate and summarize data, enabling quick insights into customer behavior.
- **Visualization Techniques:** Utilized bar graphs and charts to visually represent key metrics such as customer age distribution and sales by job industry category.
- **RFM Analysis:** Calculated recency, frequency, and monetary scores for each customer to segment them into platinum, gold, silver, and bronze categories.
- **Presentation Design:** Crafted a concise PowerPoint presentation to convey insights and recommendations to stakeholders.

# 2. Key Outcomes
- Analyzed customer data to understand trends and behavior patterns.
- Segmented customers into distinct categories based on RFM analysis.
- Developed an insightful and visually appealing PowerPoint presentation to convey findings and recommendations.

# 3. PowerPoint Presentation
I prepared a PowerPoint presentation summarizing my analysis and insights. The presentation includes:
- Customer Segmentation based on RFM scores.
- Visualizations of key metrics and trends.
- Recommendations for targeting high-value customers among the new dataset.

# Conclusion
Module 2 of the KPMG AU Data Analytics virtual internship allowed me to transition from data cleaning to data analysis and presentation. By leveraging Excel's functionalities and best practices, I successfully analyzed the provided datasets, extracted valuable insights, and visually communicated these insights using PowerPoint.
