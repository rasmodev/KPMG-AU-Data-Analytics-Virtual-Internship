# Module 1: Data Quality Assessment
Welcome to Module 1 of my KPMG AU Data Analytics virtual internship showcase! In this module, I have engaged in a comprehensive data quality assessment to ensure the readiness of the provided datasets for analysis. This README provides an overview of the tasks completed, methodologies employed, and key outcomes achieved during this module.

# 1. Introduction
Data quality is a critical aspect of any data analysis process. In this module, I employed Microsoft Excel to conduct a comprehensive data quality assessment on the datasets provided by Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. The goal was to identify and address data quality issues to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and suitability of the data for analysis.

# 1.1. Data Quality Dimensions
During the data cleaning process, I focused on the following data quality dimensions to ensure the overall quality of the datasets:
- **Accuracy:** Ensuring the correctness and accuracy of data values.
- **Completeness:** Addressing missing values and ensuring complete data records.
- **Consistency:** Standardizing data representations and formats.
- **Currency:** Updating values to maintain relevance and up-to-date information.
- **Relevancy:** Evaluating data items for valuable meta-data and meaningfulness.
- **Validity:** Verifying the conformity of data values to predefined rules.
- **Uniqueness:** Checking for unique values and removing duplicate values to ensure singularity.

## 1.2. Tasks
- **Data Inspection:** Thoroughly reviewed each dataset to understand its structure and variables.
- **Data Profiling:**  Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to profile data distributions and identify potential issues.
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values, inconsistencies, and data format errors.
- **Outlier Detection:** Detected potential outliers using statistical techniques.
- **Data Transformation:** Calculated age based on the date of birth, standardized gender values, and computed profit.
- **Email Draft:** Drafted an email to the client highlighting data quality issues and recommendations.

# 1.3. Methodologies
- **Data Validation and Transformation:** Utilized Excel's data validation, find-and-replace, and formula-based calculations to address data issues.
- **Filtering:** Applied filters to identify and clean specific data elements, ensuring data quality across columns.
- **Formula Calculations:** Employed Excel formulas to derive new insights, such as computing customer age and profit.

# 2. Key Outcomes
- Identified and addressed data quality issues, including missing values, inconsistencies, and format errors.
- Transformed raw data into a clean and structured format suitable for analysis.
- Enhanced data accuracy, completeness, and reliability across the datasets.
  
# 3. Sample Email
In line with the module's requirements, I drafted an email to the client outlining the data quality issues identified and the steps taken to mitigate them.
The Word and PDF versions of the email are attached.
